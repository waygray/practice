# Practice
yeah thats about it, if your seeing this, this is souly for practice and learning
new thing before implementing them into projects.

**I AM GOING TO ADD A LITTLE PARAGRAPH WHENEVER I FINSIHED SOMETHING, JUST SO THAT ITS NOTED DOWN WHAT THE GOAL OF THE FILE WAS**

# badcalc.py
the goal here was to do some simple work with classes, and work in handling user inputs and holding that data and using it across different functions, I am learning what I want to learn from this, this is the second time I have combbined these, so its coded poorly, but its given me a base line on how to work on these to aspects of python, to better apply them to TBGdev and future projects.
